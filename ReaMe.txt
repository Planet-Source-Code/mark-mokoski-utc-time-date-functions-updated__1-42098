Set of functions to return UTC Time / Date using some API calls
Format of functions similar to standard Time / Date
funtions in VB (Time, Time$, Date, Date$, Now)
Date functions use TimeSerial, DateSerial and Named Formats in VB,
so the output of date functions will follow conventions for the users
country/regional settings.

Example: United States date is MM/DD/YYYY, Europe is DD/MM/YYYY.

Function examples are in United States format

Also there are two funtions that return the name of the
time zone the system is set for, one the short name (like "EST"),
the second for the long name (like "Eastern Standard Time")
Some of the time zone names don't realy work
well with short names.  But it works fine for most
U.S. and Canada time zones.  Change the code as you see fit.
Short and Long Time Zone Names change to "Daylight Time"
if a daylight time zone is selected.

ISOnow              Now             ISO 8601 format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

Time zone and UTC time functions assume the correct time zone is selected
in the Time/Date properties and clock set correct local time.'
